Basic Requirements

1. NodeJS REST APIs -
  1.1 Load a properties file. [GET]
    This will read an existing properties file and return it.
  1.2 Create a properties file. [POST]
    This will allow user to create a new properties file from the GUI.
    Note: For now the set of properties will be hard coded in GUI. No funcitionality to create dynamic properties.
  1.3 Edit a properties file. [PUT]
    This will allow user to modify the properties. 
    Note: For now all properties can edited.
  1.4 Create gradle commands. [POST]
  1.5 Copy files from one location to another. [POST]
    Copy the build component to intended location.
    Note: The paths will be hard coded for now.
  1.6 Execute the gradle commands using the nodeJs libraries.
  1.7 API to start and stop the server.
  1.8 API to check status of app deployment
    Note: This is as simple as checking if the app is deployed and index page is accessible.
